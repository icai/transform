## Calculator

An **electronic calculator** is typically a portable [electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics") device used to perform [calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation "Calculation"), ranging from basic [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic") to complex [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics").

The first [solid-state electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_electronics "Solid-state electronics") calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the [Intel 4004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004 "Intel 4004"), the first [microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor "Microprocessor"), was developed by [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel "Intel") for the Japanese calculator company [Busicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busicom "Busicom"). They later became used commonly within the [petroleum industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry "Petroleum industry") (oil and gas).

Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, [credit-card-sized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7810 "ISO/IEC 7810") models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of [integrated circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit") reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.

Computer [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") as far back as [early Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_UNIX "Ancient UNIX") have included interactive calculator [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") such as [dc](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dc_(computer_program)> "Dc (computer program)") and [hoc](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoc_(programming_language)> "Hoc (programming language)"), and calculator functions are included in almost all [personal digital assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant "Personal digital assistant") (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices.

In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example, there are [scientific calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_calculator "Scientific calculator") which include [trigonometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry") and [statistical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do [computer algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra "Computer algebra"). [Graphing calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphing_calculator "Graphing calculator") can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"). As of 2016, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.

In 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity to compute information. By 2007, this had diminished to less than 0.05%.
