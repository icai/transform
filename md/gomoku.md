## Gomoku

_**Gomoku**_, also called _Five in a Row_, is an [abstract strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_strategy "Abstract strategy") [board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game "Board game"). It is traditionally played with [Go](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)> "Go (game)") pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board, using 15×15 of the 19×19 grid intersections.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference">[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku#cite_note-1)</sup> Because pieces are not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played as a [paper-and-pencil game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper-and-pencil_game "Paper-and-pencil game"). The game is known in several countries under different names.

Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Origin

Gomoku has existed in Japan since the [Meiji Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration "Meiji Restoration").<sup id="cite_ref-hzx_2-0" class="reference">[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku#cite_note-hzx-2)</sup> The name "Gomoku" is from the [Japanese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language"), in which it is referred to as _gomokunarabe_ (五目並べ). _Go_ means [five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5 "5"), _moku_ is a counter word for [pieces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_stone "Go stone") and _narabe_ means _line-up_. The game is also popular in [Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea "Korea"), where it is called _omok_ (오목 [五目]) which has the same structure and origin as the Japanese name.

The Japanese call this game Go-moku (five stones). In the nineteenth century, the game was introduced to Britain where it was known as **Go Bang**, said to be a corruption of the Japanese word _[goban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_board "Go board")_, said to be adopted from Chinese _k'i pan (qí pán)_ "go-board."<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku#cite_note-3)</sup>

## Official rules

Besides many variations around the world, the **Swap2** rule (based on "swap" from [Renju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renju "Renju")) is currently adapted in tournaments among professional players, including Gomoku World Championships.

In Swap2 rule, the first player starts by placing three stones (2 black and 1 white, if black goes first) on the board. The second player then selects one of three options: play black, play white and place one more stone, or place two more stones to and let the first player choose the color.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference">[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku#cite_note-4)</sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference">[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku#cite_note-5)</sup> This is essentially a slightly more elaborate [pie rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_rule "Pie rule").

Swap2 solved the low complexity problem<sup id="cite_ref-:0_6-0" class="reference">[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku#cite_note-:0-6)</sup> and makes the game fairer. Like other rules and variations, 100% fairness can be reached by playing two alternating games for each point.
